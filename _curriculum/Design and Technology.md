### Aims and Approach:
Design and Technology (D&amp;T) aims to nurture a way of thinking and doing through design and thinking. Students are taught to embrace uncertainty and complexity through solving real-world problems. They will also learn skills such as sketching and presentation delivery, as well as manipulation of materials.

The approach to the teaching and learning of D&amp;T is focused on:

1.  creating awareness and interest in design (lower secondary); and
2.  inculcating creativity and an innovative spirit (upper secondary).

### Key programmes:

<u>Lower Secondary</u>

<b>Coin Saver Project</b>

Students are taught basic sketching skills using paper and pencils. They translate these skills by developing a coin saver for young children. In doing so, they learn the design thinking process of identifying usersâ€™ needs and iterative prototyping. Students also get to have hands-on experience with basic workshop tools and machinery.

<b>Stationery Holder</b>

Students are taught how to use digital tools such as Sketchbook on their Personal Learning Devices. This technology-enabled solution allows them to flexibly iterate their designs and ideas. They also learn to translate these ideas into physical artefacts through creation of mock-ups for testing and review.

<u>Upper Secondary</u>

<b>Solving Real-World Problems</b>

Students are taught the design process as a way of thinking and doing. This allows them to focus on creating solutions which are purposeful and meet user needs. They are also introduced to commercial heavy-duty machineries such as the lathe and milling machines. They put together their knowledge to create working prototypes.
