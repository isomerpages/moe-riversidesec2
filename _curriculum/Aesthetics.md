# Aesthetics Unit

### Aims and Approach:

The Aesthetics department aims to ensure students have the joy in learning art and music so that they can appreciate the arts in their lives and contribute to society through various art forms. We also endeavour to promote the spirit of experiential learning and a thinking and creative culture.

The student-centric approach to the teaching and learning of art and music is informed by:

1.  inquiry-based learning
2.  collaborative learning
3.  experiential learning

### Key Programmes

<u>External Engagements</u>

Selected students participate in external competitions, performances and exhibitions such as the SYF Youth Station Songwriting Experience, N5 Cluster Art Exhibition, workshops as well as a music performance at Woodlands Regional Library. These opportunities allow them to apply their knowledge and skills.
