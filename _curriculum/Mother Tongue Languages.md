### Aims and approach:

The Mother Tongue Languages department aims to nurture students who are competent language users and confident communicators with a sense of pride in their unique culture, literature and values. Through the learning of their Mother Tongue Languages, students develop a strong sense of belonging to Singapore.

The approach to the teaching and learning of Mother Tongue Languages involves:

1.  differentiated teaching of language skills and knowledge to develop communication skills effectively for students of different learning profiles;
2.  weaving of culture, literary texts and values alongside current affairs to provide a relevant and culturally-rich learning experience;
3.  leveraging technology to support studentsâ€™ self-directed learning, exploration and teacher feedback; and
4.  working with community partners to provide out-of-the-classroom learning experiences for students to see the relevance of the Mother Tongue Languages in everyday life.

### Key programmes:

<u>Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Week</u>

The annual MTL week gives students an opportunity to immerse in a wide range of activities which help them deepen their understanding of their unique cultures, and develop their love for the language.

  

<u>Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Reading Programme</u>

The MTL Reading Programme exposes students to different genres of writing. Students have the opportunity to read short stories and news articles, and discuss them with their teachers. Through this, they gain an appreciation of how language plays a key role in communication, and its impact on the larger society. Students also get an opportunity to learn from curated sharing of good writing from their peers.

  

<u>Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) One Motivational Morning Inspiration (OMMS)</u>

The OMMS provides a platform for students to share cultural knowledge, passions and good values with their peers. They influence and inspire their peers, and help to build a positive school culture. Students also get to build their confidence and hone their communication and public-speaking skills.

  

<u>Fun with Languages</u>

As part of the Secondary 1 curriculum, for an hour every month, all students learn simple vocabulary of other Mother Tongue Languages. This helps to give them a better understanding and appreciation of the other common languages in Singapore.

  

<u>Festive Celebrations</u>

The many cultural festivals celebrated in Singapore is testament to our harmonious and multi-racial society. To share the joy of these festivities among students from different backgrounds, we celebrate Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Mid-Autumn and Deepavali annually. At these joyous occasions, our students learn more about the different cultures, traditions and practices, and join in the celebrations with their peers and teachers.

  

<u>Media Literacy Programme</u>

The Media Literacy Programme provides a platform for our students to take on the role of student news reporters and learn the skills of interviewing and reporting, gathering of information, presentation, and video crafting and production.

  

<u>School-based Competitions</u>

A variety of school-based competitions provides the opportunity for all our students to discover hidden talents, hone skills and explore alternative modes of expressing themselves. These competitions range from essay writing, storytelling and poster-making.

  

<u>Tamil Language Elective Programme (TLEP)</u>

TLEP is a 2-year programme offered to all Secondary 3 Tamil Literature students. It aims to:

1.  nurture capable and enthusiastic students to attain a high level of language proficiency and competency in using the Tamil language;
2.  enhance their knowledge and understanding of Tamil Literature and culture; and
3.  develop students to be effectively billingual to better serve the needs of our nation.

  

We also partner the larger Tamil community in the school (Tamil Language Club) to deepen the exploration of the culture and roots of the Tamil language.
