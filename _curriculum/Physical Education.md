### Aims and approach:

The Physical Education department aims to equip every student with skills and knowledge, anchored on good values, to lead a physically active and healthy lifestyle.

  

The approach to the teaching and learning of skills and concept in Physical Education involves:

1.  conducting a series of sports, fitness and conditioning, and outdoor education modules for students to learn to work collaboratively and competitively; and&nbsp;
2.  using pedagogies such as Teaching Games for Understanding (TGFU), Game-Centered Approach (GCA), Assessment for Learning through Peer- and Self-assessment.

### Key programmes:

<u>Sports Carnival</u>

All students compete in inter-class games to put into practice sport skills acquired over 8 weeks of lessons. By playing against peers from other classes and levels, they experience the competitive spirit of sports, yet appreciate the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship. Through the carnival, students also develop resilience and the determination to strive for excellence in all that they do.

<u>Outdoor Learning Programme</u>

Students are equipped with basic knowledge of orienteering, map-reading, tent-pitching and injury management during the Outdoor Education (OE) modules. The 3-day 2-night Adventure Camp for Secondary 3 students is an annual highlight. It provides an opportunity for students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired from the OE modules, as they go through a series of physical challenges as a class. Through the OE Programme, students grow to be more resilient and adaptable.
