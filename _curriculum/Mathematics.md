### Aims and approach:

The Mathematics department aims to deepen our students’ passion and to develop a positive attitude in them towards the subject, by providing them the experience of making learning relevant to “Live Maths, Love Maths”.

The approach to the teaching and learning of Mathematics involves:

1.  learning concepts through the use of manipulatives, peer-to-peer collaborations and mathematical discourse;
2.  developing process and using Polya's four-step method to solve problems; and
3.  inculcating positive attitudes, confidence and appreciation towards Mathematics.

### Key programmes:

**Crime Scene Investigation (C.S.I.)**

Students work collaboratively to solve a case by applying scientific and mathematical concepts.

**Math Trail**

Students actively demonstrate skills such as reasoning, analysis, data collection and making connections to better appreciate Mathematics and hone their thinking, listening and communication skills through the trail.

**Competitions**

Selected students participate in the Mathematics Olympiad and Normal Course Mathematics Competition.
