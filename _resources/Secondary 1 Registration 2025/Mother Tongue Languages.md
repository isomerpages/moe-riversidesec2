<p><u>(I) Higher Mother Tongue Language</u>
<br>The Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL) curriculum is designed to stretch
students who have a strong interest and aptitude in the language. Students
offering HMTL will bear a heavier curriculum and learning load, as the
subject covers additional content knowledge and skills compared to Mother
Tongue Language (MTL) as a second language taken at the G3 level under
Full Subject-Based Banding. The eligibility criteria ensures that students
possess the necessary academic ability to cope with the heavier learning
load, so that the learning of HMTL will not come at the expense of other
subjects.
<br>
<br>MOE criteria to offer HMTL:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students with an overall PSLE Score of 8 or better and offered MTL at

AL1/AL2 in MTL or Distinction/Merit in HMTL</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For students who are eligible (meet MOE's criteria) to offer HMTL, the
MOE HMTL option form will be sent via Parents Gateway. Parents/legal guardians
will be required to respond through the PG consent forms by&nbsp;24<sup>th</sup> December
2024, 11:00am.</p>
<p>Students who perform well in G3 MTL during Secondary 1 and show a strong
interest in the subject will have the opportunity to take Higher Mother
Tongue starting in Secondary 2. Please encourage your child to continue
putting effort into Mother Tongue Language.</p>
