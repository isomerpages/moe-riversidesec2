<p>Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to
nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the
different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p>With FSBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where students
learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall strengths,
interests and learning needs.</p>
<p>Eligible students can offer&nbsp;<strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong>&nbsp;at
a more demanding level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each
of these subjects.</p>
<p></p>
