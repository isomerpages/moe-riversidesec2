<p>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE's ongoing efforts
to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to
the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where
students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall
strengths, interests and learning needs. Under Full SBB, there will no
longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) streams, and students will be
in mixed form classes where they can interact with peers of different strengths
and interests.</p>
<p>At the start of Secondary One, Eligible students can offer&nbsp;English
Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science&nbsp;at a more
demanding level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each of
these subjects.</p>
<p>Please refer to MOEâ€™s <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/main.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> for
further information on Full SBB.</p>
<p><u>For eligible students ONLY</u>

level on&nbsp;21<sup>st</sup> December 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do&nbsp;consider discussing with your&nbsp;child/ward&nbsp;what FSBB entails
