The Direct School Admission Exercise (DSA) allows students to seek admission to Riverside Secondary School based on a range of achievements and talents.

  

Students who have excellent leadership skills or specific academic talents, may apply for DSA. The DSA talent areas offered by Riverside for 2023 will be published in April.
