<p><strong>2023 Parenting Workshops</strong>
</p>
<p>In March, PSG organised a workshop titled "Building a Positive Digital
Family Culture Together." Parents and guardians received valuable tips
and parenting strategies to cultivate a positive digital environment within
their families.</p>
<p>Another workshop dedicated to youths’ mental health was organised in July.
Parents learned to monitor and identify signs that could provide crucial
information about their children's well-being. The session aimed to create
a safe space for mental health-focused conversations in their homes.</p>
<p><em>"In one of the workshops, we learnt that kids at the age around 12-14, their emotional brain grows faster than their logical brain, which we will see bursts of emotional fluctuations from them. This helps me to remain calm when they gets agitated, and allows me to calm them down before guiding them." - Parent of a Secondary 1 student</em>

<p><strong>Riverside Family Reunion</strong>
</p>
<p>In May, our PSG organised the Riverside Family Reunion, a meticulously
planned event that offered a diverse range of activities designed to nurture
strong bonds among the extended Riverside Family.</p>
<p>The day unfolded with spirited badminton matches that encouraged friendly
competition among participants. Captain's Ball served as another dynamic
platform, fostering teamwork and camaraderie as teams strategised, cheered,
and jubilantly celebrated their victories. For those inclined toward culinary
creativity, a baking session took center stage as one of the day's highlights.
Parents and children joined forces, engaging in the delightful process
of creating delectable cupcakes together.</p>
