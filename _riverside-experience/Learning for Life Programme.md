<p>Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Digital Citizenship, underscores
the importance of using technology for positive purposes, encouraging students
to harness digital tools for creativity, innovation, and social good. By
empowering students with these life skills and values, the LLP prepares
Riversidians to be resilient and responsible digital citizens.</p>
<p>Lower secondary students are provided with opportunities to explore various
digital literacies such as digital note-taking for learning organisation,
mind mapping for concept visualisation, information literacy for cultivation
of critical thinking skills, emerging technologies like generative AI to
foster innovation and video production to enhance their communication skills.</p>
