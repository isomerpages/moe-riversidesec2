### Aims:

Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Arts for Life, is designed to bring out the artist in every Riversidian. Through a range of programmes catered to a wide variety of aesthetic interests, our students learn to appreciate the arts as well as express themselves through various art forms.

Lower secondary students are given opportunities to learn various art forms such as dance, digital song arrangement and dramatic poetry recitation.

### Highlights:

<u>Riverside's Got Talent (RSGT) and Creative Arts Awards Competitions</u>

Students with deeper interests in the performing and visual arts have the opportunity to participate in the annual RSGT and Creative Arts Awards competitions to showcase their artistic abilities. RSGT participants are given the opportunity to further hone their skills through masterclass workshops. They gain insights into original dance choreography and learn to develop their vocal abilities from a professional vocal coach.
