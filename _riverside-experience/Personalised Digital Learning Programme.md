### Aims:

The Riverside iExperience is a collection of programmes developed to develop students’ digital literacy and cultivate responsible habits in the use of technology. Taking reference from the goals of the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and the CCE 2021 syllabus, the Riverside iExperience aims to grow Riversidians into future-ready digital learners and leaders of tomorrow.

### Highlights:

<u>Roll-out of Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) to Secondary 1 Students</u>

Every year, our newly minted Riversidians receive their PLDs from their form teachers with great excitement. During the unboxing experience, our students learn the importance of healthy digital habits and pledge their commitment to using their PLDs in a safe and responsible manner.

<u>Let’s IT it</u>

To equip students with new digital learning routines and to develop productivity skills in areas such as note-taking and scheduling, a set of self-guided modules, “Let’s IT it”, is introduced to our Secondary 1 Riversidians. Developed in-house on the Student Learning Space (SLS) platform, these modules allow students to pick up productivity skills at their own pace to enhance their learning.

<u>ICT Ambassadors</u>

A key component in the Riverside iExperience is to develop student leaders to serve as subject matter experts and role models in the use of technology. Our ICT Ambassadors are given the opportunity to develop computational thinking skills through enrichment programmes exploring the Swift programming language. They are then given the opportunity to also guide their peers in a coding activity during the Riverside Integrated Skills Experience (RISE).

  

<u>Assembly Programmes</u>

With the support of organisations such as the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, various assembly programmes and pop-up booths are also organised to empower our students to become discerning and responsible users of technology.
