#### STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) \[NEW!\]

Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is a new DSA talent area offered at Riverside. In the 21st century, every job is likely to require some element of STEM. STEM education develops a range of transferable skills such as creativity, critical thinking, digital literacy and communication skills.

Our unique Riverside STEM education is specially designed to provide students with real-world learning experiences to develop skills and values that prepare them for the future. They will enhance their coding literacy, hone their problem-solving skills and be developed to be stewards of the environment and changemakers in sustainability.

As part of Riverside STEM education, our signature Media Literacy curriculum is tailored for students to learn digital skills: Curate (information literacy), Connect (digital collaboration) and Create (fluency in using digital tools). This will enable them to thrive in the digital networked environment.

Students can also look forward to grow their aspirations and passions in STEM through the following ways:

●     Robotics Club: Students will learn coding and will be engaged in various hands-on activities to develop their creativity, critical thinking skills and resilience to come up with innovative solutions.

●     Environmental Science Club: Students will be immersed in the use of Science to devise innovative solutions through research and scientific investigations to solve environmental issues.

*Participating in robotics competitions and workshops can start off easy but become progressively challenging. Despite this, our club members always support one another to overcome challenges through discussions and experimentation. We learned important values such as teamwork and perseverance. We also sharpened our critical thinking skills as we worked through the problems. Now, we seniors are guiding our juniors for their competitions so that they will have a great experience as well! – Nitin*

_In the Environmental Science Club, I learned how to manage hydroponics sets and use micro-controllers. I also learned the importance of sustainability. This has developed values such as responsibility in my peers and me as we have to clean and refill the water tank weekly. I also had the opportunity to prepare for the school-wide celebration for Earth Day 2023 and contributed to the creation of learning materials used to educate and inspire my schoolmates to reduce their carbon footprint. My time in this CCA has taught me about how we can use Science to reduce Man’s negative impact on the environment. - Chee Chung King, Ehren_
