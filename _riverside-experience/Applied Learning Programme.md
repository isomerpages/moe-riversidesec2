<h3>Aims:</h3>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme, Global Citizenship Education Through Critical
Social Inquiry (GCE through CSI), aims to develop students into lifelong
learners with values, beliefs and attitudes that support responsible global
citizenship.</p>
<p>GCE is a way of understanding, acting and relating oneself to others and
the environment based on universal values. This cultivates respect for
diversity and pluralism. The CSI approach facilitates the creation and
understanding of deeper knowledge that leads to citizenship outcomes.</p>
<p>The programme invites students to explore pertinent global issues based
on the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Students learn
to empathise with affected communities, and develop the thinking and tools
to be agents of change</p>
<h3>Highlights:</h3>
<p><u>Riverside Model United Nations (RSMUN)</u>
</p>
<p>In 2022, the theme for RSMUN was ‘Building an Inclusive Society’. Students
assumed the role of prominent figures to discuss contemporary issues relevant
to the global and local contexts such as meritocracy, race and social class.
Through the discussions, students came up with resolutions to address these
issues and gained a better understanding of how they play a part to build
a more inclusive society in Singapore.</p>
