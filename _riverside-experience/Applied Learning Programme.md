<h3>Aims:</h3>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme, Global Citizenship Education Through Critical
Social Inquiry (GCE through CSI), aims to develop students into lifelong
learners with values, beliefs and attitudes that support responsible global
citizenship.</p>
<p>GCE is a way of understanding, acting and relating oneself to others and
the environment based on universal values. This cultivates respect for
diversity and pluralism. The CSI approach facilitates the creation and
understanding of deeper knowledge that leads to citizenship outcomes.</p>
<p>The programme invites students to explore pertinent global issues based
on the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Students learn
to empathise with affected communities, and develop the thinking and tools
to be agents of change</p>
<h3>Highlights:</h3>
<p><u>Riverside Model United Nations (RSMUN)</u>
</p>
<p>The 2025 RSMUN theme, <em>“Innovation and Inclusion: Forging a Progressive Nation,”</em> encouraged
students to engage with timely debates on how technology, sustainability,
and social integration can move societies forward. Representing key figures,
they examined both global and local perspectives, formulating resolutions
that highlighted their role in co-creating Singapore’s progressive future.</p>
