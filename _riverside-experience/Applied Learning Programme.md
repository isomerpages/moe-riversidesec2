### Aims:

Our Applied Learning Programme, Global Citizenship Education Through Critical Social Inquiry (GCE through CSI), aims to develop students into lifelong learners with values, beliefs and attitudes that support responsible global citizenship.

GCE is a way of understanding, acting and relating oneself to others and the environment based on universal values. This cultivates respect for diversity and pluralism. The CSI approach facilitates the creation and understanding of deeper knowledge that leads to citizenship outcomes.

The programme invites students to explore pertinent global issues based on the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Students learn to empathise with affected communities, and develop the thinking and tools to be agents of change

### Highlights:

<u>Riverside Model United Nations (RSMUN)</u>

In 2022, the theme for RSMUN was ‘Building an Inclusive Society’. Students assumed the role of prominent figures to discuss contemporary issues relevant to the global and local contexts such as meritocracy, race and social class. Through the discussions, students came up with resolutions to address these issues and gained a better understanding of how they play a part to build a more inclusive society in Singapore.
