### Aims:

Riverside's signature RISE programme (Riverside Integrated Skills Experience) is an annual cohort-level programme that aims to systematically develop a range of self-management, socio-emotional, thinking, digital skills and other 21st century competencies in Riversidians.

Lower secondary focuses on developing self-directedness, self-concept and self-leadership. In upper secondary, our students go beyond the school to learn and serve and are equipped with a range of life skills for post-secondary education.

### Highlights:

<u>Secondary 1</u>

Students learn more about themselves as they went through profiling to get to know their strengths better so that they can leverage these strengths while they are adjusting to secondary school life. They are also exposed to new experiences and acquired relevant skills through activities such as Code for Fun where they built and presented their own prototypes of their future smart homes.

<u>Secondary 2</u>

Students are shaped into self-directed individuals who can make informed decisions. They are introduced to the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership when they participate in The Leadership Challenge. Over a series of team activities, students have to model the way, challenge the process and enable others to act towards a common goal.

  

<u>Secondary 3</u>

Students learn to embrace the growth mindset as they engaged in activities in the Outdoor Adventure Camp to overcome challenges and obstacles. They have the opportunity to go outdoors to experience basic first aid, outdoor cooking and orienteering. Students also learned the importance of teamwork. The skills and attitudes they acquire are applicable in other aspects of their lives.

<u>Secondary 4 and 5</u>

Students gain insights into their post-secondary education as they participated in conversations during various Educational Career Guidance workshops. They are equipped with knowledge and skills to face the challenges ahead as they graduate from the school.
