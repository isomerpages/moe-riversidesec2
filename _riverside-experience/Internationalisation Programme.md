### Aims:

The internationalisation programme aims to:

1.  provide opportunities for our students to expand their horizons;
2.  forge bonds with peers from our twinning schools; and
3.  develop our students as global citizens of the world.

### Highlights:

<u>Exploration of diverse cultures across Asia</u>

In 2022, for the second year running, Riverside’s signature Internationalisation Programme was brought online as we offered our students the opportunity to explore diverse cultures across Asia. Our Secondary 3 students immersed in the Internationalisation Programme through a wholesome sharing by esteemed local guides. They learned more about the distinctive geographical and historical backgrounds of these countries. The session rounded off with an immersive 360-degree interactive tour of all three countries, aided by a virtual-reality headset no less.

<u>Interactive Zoom exchange</u>

In 2022, the second leg of the programme witnessed our continuing commitment to our long-term twinning schools – Perdana Wazir Secondary School, of Brunei; Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya, of India; and Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Kwok Yat Wai College, of Hong Kong China. Via an interactive Zoom exchange, students shared enthusiastically about their respective schooling experiences and exchanged pointers on how they tackled issues such as climate change and responsible consumption and production. By the end of the session, strong bonds were definitely forged among these new friends.
