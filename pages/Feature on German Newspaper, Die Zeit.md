Lin himself wears a headset and records the lesson in case someone wants to review it at home. If the students didn't wear their light blue uniforms, one could think of being at a university, so quiet and focused the work is."</em></p><hr><p><em>"Lin says he builds on what educators in Germany also call scaffolding in teaching: the teaching unit is considered a scaffold, where each child can climb higher if capable. In other words, those who want to learn more always get new, challenging material. "You have to go beyond the limit to even know where it is," says Lin."</em></p><hr><p><em>"A question to Riverside Secondary School Principal Yoke Chun Tham: What do you pay particular attention to in the applications of new teachers? " The willingness to always want to improve oneself," answers Tham. "Anyone who thinks they don't need to learn anything more as a teacher has chosen the wrong profession." That too is one of those key terms that everyone constantly talks about: to improve, to get better. Oneself, the school, the education system."</em></p><p></p><p><strong>You may access the original article in Deutsch <a href="https://www.zeit.de/2023/53/bildung-singapur-erfolg-pisa-studie" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
