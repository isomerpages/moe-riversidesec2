### Aims

Visual Arts aims to:  

1.  Develop skills and talents of our students in art-related activities
2.  Nurture and promote aesthetics appreciation in our students and impart life skills in them through engaging programmes; and  
    
3.  Enhance creativity in our students and inculcate in them our school values.  
    

### Key events and achievements:

<u>Art Jamming</u>

Our members conducted two art jamming sessions with Riverside students this year. Together with the strong support of the ICT department, we were able to record and broadcast our drypoint and copper tooling art jamming activities in Term 3. Teachers and students both had fun getting their hands on creating these crafts.

<u>SYF Art Exhibition 2022</u>

Seven of our Secondary 3 members received the Certificate of Recognition at the SYF Art Exhibition 2022. Their drypoint art piece titled ‘Irreplaceable Artist, Sustainable Future’ was displayed at the National Museum of Singapore in conjunction with the event.

Benedict Chew (4/7) also did us proud when he was awarded with the Special Mention Award at the ‘Live on Festival 2022 Design Competition’ organised by the National Organ Transplant Unit.
