### Aims
Modern Dance aims to:  

1.  Nurture our students into fine dancers with confidence and resilience, living up to the motto ‘Dance to express, not to impress’; and
2.  Expose our students to and hone their skills in different genres of contemporary dance, e.g. ballet, jazz and hip-hop.

### Key events and achievements

<u>35th&nbsp;Speech and Prize-Giving Day Performance</u>

Unlike previous years, our modern dancers presented two different genres of dance instead of just one.The first piece was a contemporary piece titled ‘The Harmony of Black and White’ which illustrates the dichotomous yin-yang associated with teamwork, harmony and co-creation. The second performance was a hip-hop dance to the hit ‘Money’. It was clear that the hip-hop tune was well-received as students cheered loudly for our dancers throughout the performance.
