### Key events and achievements

<u>35th&nbsp;Speech and Prize-Giving Day Performance</u>

Our dancers put up a performance titled ‘Ala Donde Si Donde’, a celebratory dance to mark the end of a long period of harvesting season. The fast tempo of the song illustrates the happiness farmers feel after a season of fruitful harvests. The dance movements also include the influences of dikir barat. The dynamic, sharp and energetic movements depict the important culture of ‘gotong royong’ or community spirit.

<u>Hari Raya Concert Performance</u>

Our dancers took part in a drama cum dance concert to celebrate the joyous spirit of Hari Raya. Dancing to a remix of different Hari Raya songs from different eras showcased our dancers’ versatility.

<u>FAM K @ North West 2022</u>

As part of our Values In Action (VIA), our dancers performed a dance for the elderly in conjunction with National Day. The dance titled ‘Kurik Kundi’ was well received by the elderly and volunteers. We received commendation from the organiser that we had put up an eye-catching and graceful dance performance that brought cheer to the elderly.
