### Key events and achievements

<u>National Day Concert Performance</u>

Our members were both elated and excited to have had the opportunity to perform for the school after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. For the National Day celebration this year, our actors staged our adaptation of Haresh Sharma’s ‘History, Whose Story’ for the school. The play provides an exhilarating remembrance, with a touch of humour, of our country’s history and the many different perspectives to it.

<u>The LKY Musical</u>

Our members had the opportunity to catch ‘The LKY Musical’ at the Sands Theatre. Watching the musical provided an enriching opportunity for our members to broaden their horizons through the appreciation of professional performances.

<u>Video and Audio Drama Production</u>

Our members embarked on the exploration of the diverse theatrical mediums this year by branching into both video and audio drama as part of their development as actors. Having participated in the Digital Drama Challenge and winning best production for both categories last year, our members took the opportunity to further hone their craft this year.

<u>Drama Camp</u>

Our members organised their annual Drama Camp this year. The camp provided a platform for them to know one another better, build stronger teamwork and allowed the seniors to showcase their skills and leadership through the planning and execution of training activities.
