### Key events and achievements

<u>North Zone Basketball ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions Tournaments 2022</u>

Our players took part in the North Zone Basketball ‘C’ and ‘B’ Divisions competitions this year and they gave their best for all the games. It was truly an enriching experience for them as they had not participated in the national games since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. They had the opportunity to experience the adrenaline rush when they competed with teams from other schools.
