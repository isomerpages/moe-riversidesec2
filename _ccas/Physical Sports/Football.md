<u>North Zone Football ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions Tournaments 2022</u>

The National School Games football tournament was eagerly anticipated by our footballers after the ease of Covid-19 measures. Grouped together with storied opposition in the form of Singapore Sports School and other noteworthy teams, our team went into the tournament unfazed and chalked up impressive victories and gripping games to earn them third place in both the ‘C’ and ‘B’ Divisions preliminary rounds. Our team is looking ahead to build on the progress made, ready for the next challenge.
