### Aims

Netball aims to:  

1.  Build knowledge in students to adopt a healthy and active lifestyle, and participate in a range of competitive, friendly and challenge-type activities, both as individuals and as part of a team;
2.  Develop skills in students required for tournaments or friendly matches; and
3.  Inculcate school values and build confidence in students during netball training sessions.

### Key events and achievements

<u>North Zone Netball ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions Tournaments 2022</u>

The girls were elated with the resumption of NSG, after two years of not being able to play competitively. They were determined to give their all and gain as much experience from the competition. They trained hard beyond CCA sessions to get themselves prepared. With pride and perseverance, the girls fought relentlessly while representing the school. Our ‘C’ Division girls competed against Fuchun Secondary School and won 26-3.

  
<u>Combined Sports Camp 2022</u>

After being on a hiatus for two years, the Combined Sports Camp was organised again. The camp was aimed at forging camaraderie with other CCA athletes through common challenging experiences and increasing the knowledge of sports psychology to improve their athletic performance and mental wellness. The two-day camp was packed with programmes such as a talk by Mr Steven Tay, former Deputy Director of Physical Sports MOE on Character in Sporting Excellence, a track event at YIJC, an intersports game and a sharing session by various SEA Games athletes. From this camp, students gained friendship, knowledge and insights into how to be better athletes.
