### Aims:

The Environmental Science Club aims to:

1.  cultivate in students a love for nature which translates to actionable steps that reduce manâ€™s impact on the environment; and
2.  nurture environmental champions through experiential and authentic learning grounded by the Scientific Method.

### Key events and achievements:

Environmental Club is a new CCA in 2023.

  

Through self-directed, experiential, and authentic learning, students will learn more about different environmental themes and how they can take actionable steps through scientific research to personally make a difference. They can build upon what was learnt in the school-based curriculum and make an impact on the community through their personal habits and influencing others.


The CCA experience involves students taking the initiative to learn and apply scientific skills in conducting investigations related to environmental issues. Students will be given opportunities to plan, execute and lead school-wide campaigns which focus on raising awareness of pertinent environmental issues. Building on their love for nature and the environment, students will influence others through being role models in undertaking steps to lead a sustainable lifestyle.
