### Aims

The Robotics Club aims to:  

1.  Build creativity, critical thinking skills, resilience and co-operation among its members in an innovative and enjoyable way; and
2.  Develop in its members a life-long interest in robotics and its various applications.

### Key events and achievements

<u>FIRST LEGO League Competition</u>

Utilising a problem-based approach to develop their critical thinking skills, our members obtained a Certificate of Participation in the FIRST LEGO League Competition.

<u>Sensetime AI Bootcamp</u>

This 5-day bootcamp allowed our members to gain insights into what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all about. This event was organised by IMDA, in partnership with SenseTime and Coding Lab. Our members took part in the SenseTime AI Bootcamp to learn how AI is integrated in our lives today. Two teams were sent for this competition. One team obtained a Certificate of Distinction and Best Concept and the other team obtained a Certificate of Accomplishment at the Sensetime AI Bootcamp Hackathon competition.

<u>National Robotics Competition</u>

Arya Aditri Pani from 1 Service represented the school in the Robomission (Regular) Secondary category. She was awarded the Judges Award for displaying splendid composure during her presentation, and for exuding confidence and sound content knowledge when answering their questions.

<u>Other Workshops</u>

Besides robot building and programming, and doing Micro:bit microcontroller interfacing and programming, members were also introduced to a wide range of hands-on activities such as introductory Python coding and cloud computing that allowed them to stay abreast of the latest innovations in the world of computing. Our Secondary 4 members also organised a robotics workshop for the lower secondary members to introduce them to SCRATCH programming.
