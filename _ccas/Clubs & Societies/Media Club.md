### Key events and achievements

<u>Our School, Our Stories photo and video contest</u>

This year, our members took part in the annual ‘Our School, Our Stories’ Photo and Video Contest organised by MOE to showcase the fascinating stories of everyday school life. Our members worked hard and showcased their photography and videography skills. Their production won the hearts of the judges. They not only won an honorary mention, they also clinched the Best Video Award.

  

<u>Speech Day Video ‘Aspirations of Riversidians’</u>

To showcase the aspirations of our Riversidians, our members worked together to produce a video for Speech Day. The video, which was well received by our students and teachers as it illustrated our dreams and desires for a better future, aligned with the Speech Day theme of ‘Beyond the Horizons’.
