### Aims

AV Crew aims to:  

1.  carry out the smooth running of school activities and programmes through:  

i. operating the public announcement for daily flag raising;  

ii. providing sound and visual projection support for assemblies and school activities; and  

iii. providing sound, lighting, visual projection and backstage support for performances in the school hall.

### Key events and achievements:

AV Crew continued to operate the public address system for the school’s morning flag raising.

<u>School Events</u>

In the first half of 2022, AV Crew provided audio streaming support for some school events that included Student Leaders Investiture and 35th&nbsp;Speech and Prize-Giving Day.

After safe management measures were eased, AV Crew provided the logistical assistance for the school’s daily flag raising and assembly in the hall. Our crew also supported major school-wide activities and events such as our 35th Speech and Prize-Giving Day, National Day Celebration and Teachers’ Day Celebration.

One of our highlights for our AV crew members this year was providing support for our Riverside Dance as the finale for our 35th Speech and Prize-Giving Day. The whole school came together for RS Dance at parade square, after a two-and-half year hiatus.

With the increase in demand for AV crew’s support for school activities and events, our members will get more hands-on training opportunities to hone their skills and foster teamwork among themselves.
