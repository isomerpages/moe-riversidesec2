    <td style="border: 1px solid black" class="tg-0lax">As a member of the AV crew, I have the experience of working backstage to support the various events held by the school. My first event involved supporting our school’s Speech Day. It was a challenging experience but with the amazing support of my seniors and teachers, I managed to learn meaningful lessons. I always look forward to working with the rest of the AV crew as we work hand in hand to make every school event a success. - Nur Shafeefa Binte Muhamad Mustafa</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid black" class="tg-0lax">When I first joined Media Club, everything seemed new to me. I had a hard time learning the basics of photography. I saw this as a challenge that I had to overcome. My journey was not easy but thanks to my seniors and teachers, I sharpened my skills and am now more confident in presenting my work. I’m glad that I was given the opportunity to lead the club as one of the EXCO members. - Bilah Izzah Bahirah Binte Mohammad Noor</td>

Despite this, our club members always support one another to  overcome challenges through discussions and trial and error. We learned important values such as teamwork and perseverance. We also sharpened our critical thinking skills through the process. Now, we seniors are guiding our juniors for their competitions so that they will have a great experience as well! – Nitin</td>

    <td style="border: 1px solid black" class="tg-0lax">In Badminton, we learned the basic skills of badminton such as ways to swing the racket and the correct footwork. We worked closely during intensive training to prepare ourselves for competitions. While the road would be fraught with many challenges, we always put in our best efforts in all the training sessions. Even if we did not achieve our target, we know we have tried our best and we are proud of ourselves. - Yuki Lee</td>
    <td style="border: 1px solid black" class="tg-0lax">I’ve had such an amazing experience being in basketball! Even though the training sessions were rigorous, I saw  improvements in my skills. Being in basketball also helped me make good friends whom I can trust and enjoy the CCA with. I appreciate the opportunity to help my juniors and for me to grow as a basketball player together with the team. I will never forget all the memorable and fun moments during the training sessions. - Amirah Raihanah Binte Abdul Halim </td>

In BB, I was given many opportunities to hone my character and be an active contributor to society. I also learned soft skills such as leadership and teamwork, and also learned technical skills like tent setting and kayaking. The memories I have made bonding with my peers through BB will be memories that I will cherish for many years to come. - Staff Sergeant Casimsiman Jared Maynard Cipriano </td>

We know that no matter the activity we participate in, we will always get something enriching out of it. - Ananya Kiran</td>
