### Aims

National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) aims to:  

1.  Provide an enriching and meaningful journey where our cadets are given the opportunity to learn skills tied to the Singapore Civil Defence Force; and
2.  Provide opportunities for our cadets to participate in other enrichment and team-building activities organised by the unit.

### Key events and achievements

<u>NCDCC Service Month and Total Defence Day</u>

Weekly training sessions allow our cadets to participate in activities such as first aid, foot drills and performing community service. During the NCDCC service month and the commemoration of Total Defence Day, our cadets conducted first aid training for their fellow Riversidians as part of service to the community.

<u>Instructional Video Competition by NCDCC Headquaters (HQ)</u>

Over the June holiday, our unit sent in two teams to participate in the instructional video competition organised by NCDCC HQ. One team won the commendation award.

<u>Other Events</u>

Some of our cadets also took part in the National Day Parade, Urban Adventure Civil Defence Skill Challenge and the Precision Drill Competition.
