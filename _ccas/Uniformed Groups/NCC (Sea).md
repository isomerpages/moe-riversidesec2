### Aims

National Cadet Corps (NCC) (Sea) aims to:  

1.  Nurture inspiring leaders and committed citizens through fun, adventurous and military-related activities; and
2.  Serve the needs of our school and our various stakeholders.

### Key events and achievements

<u>Kayaking and Dragon Boat Activities</u>

Our cadets participated in various outdoor physical activities this year. These included the 1-Star Kayaking Course to equip cadets with kayaking proficiency and water confidence. The 2022 Pesta Sukan Dragonboat Competition also forged a spirit of tenacity and teamwork among them.

<u>Army Open House 2022</u>

Our cadets also attended the Army Open House 2022 to better understand the mission and capabilities of the Singapore Army and participated in a sea tour by the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore to aid their learning of seamanship. Our commitment to our cadetsâ€™ learning through innovative practices was recognised this year when we received Distinction for the 2022 NCC HQ Unit Recognition assessment.
