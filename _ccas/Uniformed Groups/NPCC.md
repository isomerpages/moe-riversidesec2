### Aims

National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) aims to:  

1.  Develop our cadets to be active citizens and community leaders;
2.  Equip our cadets with leadership qualities, strong character and civic, social and moral values; and
3.  Develop a culture that encourages our cadets to treat others with respect, courtesy and tact.

### Key events and achievements

<u>22 Revolver Shooting</u>

Our Secondary 3 cadets were fortunate to have the opportunity to handle the .22 revolver and fire live bullets at the Home Team Academy. This is no doubt one of the highlights of a cadetâ€™s journey in NPCC.

<u>Camp Resilience</u>

The main highlight of the year came during a day enrichment trip to Camp Resilience in Pulau Ubin. Our cadets were able to apply outdoor survival skills (tent-pitching, knot-tying, field cooking and orienteering) they learned during their weekly CCA sessions to complete the activities planned.

<u>Community Safety and Security</u>

Our cadets also fulfilled their duties as police youth ambassadors by playing a part in community safety and security. Projects were brought to the classrooms where our cadets shared crime prevention messages through presentations and interactive games.

<u>Achievement</u>

Our unit received the Unit Overall Proficiency Award (Gold) for the year 2021.
