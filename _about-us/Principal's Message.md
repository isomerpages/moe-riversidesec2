<p>Since its humble beginnings in 1987, Riverside Secondary School has grown
to become a choice school in the north with its excellent track record.
In 2009 and 2015, the school received the prestigious MOE School Distinction
Award which was no mean feat. This award recognises high-achieving schools
with well-defined processes that lead to sustained achievements in student
outcomes. Since then, the school continues to strive for excellence.</p>
<h4><strong>Leading Riverside</strong></h4>
<p>In my professional career over the years, I have played different roles
– a teacher, curriculum designer, policy-maker and school principal. I
was formerly the Director of Curriculum Policy and a Director at the Educational
Technology Division at the Ministry of Education. In my MOE HQ stints,
I had the opportunity to formulate and shape education policies, and worked
across different schools from primary, secondary and junior college levels
on curriculum, assessment and educational technology.</p>
<p>What has been constant throughout my career is my unwavering commitment
to the holistic education of children. I am cognisant that each and every
child is unique and different. Being an educator is about growing the child
as an individual with his or her own self-worth and the moral integrity
to do what is right even when no one is watching. We know that education
is more than just equipping students with knowledge and skills. At Riverside,
we believe in anchoring our students in strong school values (Respect,
Service, Synergy, Passion, Integrity, Responsibility, Innovation, Tenacity)
to guide their actions in their daily lives, as a student, as a son or
daughter, and a member of the community.</p>
<h4><strong>Growing the Students</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>“Students to know who they are, have a zest for life, and always do good. Values are at the core and they are equipped with the relevant competencies to navigate the changing world.”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>In Riverside, we aim to grow every Riversidian as a <em>Future-Ready Learner, one who is equipped </em>with
essential life skills to be a self-directed and collaborative learner.</p>
<p>This premises on a strong academic foundation. Our students excel at the
national examinations in terms of eligibility for post-secondary education
and quality distinctions in subjects. This is testament to the quality
teaching and learning at Riverside.</p>
<p>We have a unique <strong>Riverside media literacy curriculum</strong>.
Students are equipped with essential media literacy skills to curate, connect
and create. Students are also equipped with cyber wellness knowledge and
they develop digital fluency to navigate the digital space.</p>
<p>We continue to place emphasis on <strong>student leadership development</strong>.
Student leaders have come together to work on meaningful causes and contribute
to the community through the Values in Action (VIA) programme. Student
leaders worked on assignments to apply the leadership knowledge and skills
learnt through the leadership modules they attended. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We focus on <strong>engaging the student voice</strong>. Platforms are
created to encourage student-led initiatives, such the annual peer-led
Riverside Model United Nations Conference (RSMUN), level dialogue sessions,
and student-initiated VIA. Student leaders are also invited to share their
perspectives to co-shape the school plans.</p>
<p>Students are also developed in <strong>growth mindset</strong>. Through
growth mindset, we want to cultivate in students a love for learning and
resilience to face any challenges.&nbsp; Students are taught positive habits,
such as help-seeking strategies and how to receive and act on feedback.
In addition, other life skills such as time management, sleep management
and goal-setting are taught.</p>
<h4><strong>Growing the Teachers</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>“Good teachers are masterful learners, who constantly grow in their professional craft, find meaning and joy in their work, and spark curiosity in their students.”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Riverside teachers form <strong>communities of practice</strong> among themselves
to learn, design lessons and reflect using students’ works regularly. Teachers
explore student-centric pedagogies, create one-to-one learning experiences,
and design better assessment tasks. Learning is joyful.</p>
<p>Riverside teachers are <strong>designers of learning experiences.</strong>
</p>
<p>They design <strong><em>Self-Directed Learning</em></strong>, encouraging
students to take ownership of their learning. For instance, in Mathematics
learning, teachers leverage technology<em> </em>to get students to inquire,
annotate, make notes, discuss and share ideas. The learning process is
captured. Students engage in self-paced learning by viewing the recorded
lessons anytime, anywhere at their own pace. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They design <strong><em>Collaborative Learning</em></strong><em>,</em> where
students are encouraged to work together in groups to co-construct meaning
with their peers. &nbsp;For instance, in Geography learning, students use
tools such as <em>Geographic Information System (GIS)</em> to conduct investigation
in the field and create digital maps of Woodlands neighbourhood collectively.</p>
<p>They design for <strong><em>Personalised Learning</em></strong>, where
students’ individual needs are catered to. For instance, to build oral
communication skills in English Language and Mother Tongue Language, students
record their own oral recordings and upload them to the MOE Singapore Student
Learning Space (SLS) and receive individualised marks and feedback.</p>
<p>Our RSS teachers are trailblazers. Several schools made requests to visit
our classrooms and to learn about our teaching and learning practices.
We have hosted a number of primary and secondary schools, and shared our
good practices at national, zonal and cluster levels. Our teachers also
have also presented papers at local and international conferences.</p>
<h4><strong>Onward and Beyond</strong></h4>
<p>In line with MOE movement on Future of Learning, the school is well positioned
to take the students into the next lap. We are a forward-looking school
with a responsive curriculum that develops the future-ready learners and
grow the 21st century educators.</p>
<p>We have strong partnerships with experts from MOE HQ, an amazing Parent
Support Group, enthusiastic Riverside Alumni and a highly supportive School
Advisory Committee. These partners have enriched our students’ learning.
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to the new year with optimism and excitement to work closely
with various partners in education to provide a quality educational experience
at Riverside.</p>
