The blue 'C' denotes the school as a caring community in a challenging learning environment.  
  
The red circle represents the focal point of the school which is the all-round development of the Riversidian in the cognitive, social, moral, physical and aesthetics domains.  
  
The Riversidian will develop values and life skills that will enable him to leap forward and embrace the global challenges of tomorrow.

### School Motto

<h5><i>My Best and More</i></h5>

### School Song

My Best and More

<i>Lyrics by O. J. Balasingam, Music by Adeline Wong</i>

  

In the north where the waters ride high <br>
Stands a school where spirits never die <br>
Committed to build a community <br>
One heart, one mind, one destiny

  

My best and more, <br>
Believing in our hearts and will <br>
My best and more, <br>
Striving until time stands still

  

Riverside, far as the eye can see <br>
Making dreams turn into reality <br>
Together in perfect harmony <br>
One will, one road, one eternity

  

My best and more, <br>
Believing in our hearts and will <br>
My best and more, <br>
Striving until time stands still
