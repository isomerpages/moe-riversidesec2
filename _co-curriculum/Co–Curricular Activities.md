<p>As a member of the AV crew, I have the experience of working backstage
to support the various events held by the school. My first event involved
supporting our school’s Speech Day. It was a challenging experience but
with the amazing support of my seniors and teachers, I managed to learn
meaningful lessons. I always look forward to working with the rest of the
AV crew as we work hand in hand to make every school event a success. -

<p>When I first joined Media Club, everything seemed new to me. I had a hard
time learning the basics of photography. I saw this as a challenge that
I had to overcome. My journey was not easy but thanks to my seniors and
teachers, I sharpened my skills and am now more confident in presenting
my work. I’m glad that I was given the opportunity to lead the club as
one of the EXCO members. - Bilah Izzah Bahirah Binte Mohammad Noor</p>

<p>Participating in robotics competitions and workshops can start off easy
but become progressively challenging. Despite this, our club members always
support one another to overcome challenges through discussions and trial

We also sharpened our critical thinking skills through the process. Now,
we seniors are guiding our juniors for their competitions so that they

<p>In Environmental Science Club, I learned how to manage hydroponics sets.
This has developed values such as responsibility in my peers and me as
we have to clean and refill the water tank weekly. I also had the opportunity
to prepare for the school-wide celebration for Earth Day 2023 and contributed
to the creation of learning materials used to educate and inspire my school-mates
to reduce their carbon footprint. My time in this CCA has taught me about
how we can use Science to reduce Man’s impact on the environment. - Chee
