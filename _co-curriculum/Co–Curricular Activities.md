        <p>As a member of the AV crew, I have the experience of working backstage
          to support the various events held by the school. My first event involved
          supporting our school’s Speech Day. It was a challenging experience but
          with the amazing support of my seniors and teachers, I managed to learn
          meaningful lessons. I always look forward to working with the rest of the
          AV crew as we work hand in hand to make every school event a success. -

          I had to overcome. My journey was not easy but thanks to my seniors and
          teachers, I sharpened my skills and am now more confident in presenting

        <p>Indian Dance has given me many opportunities to grow as a dancer and a
          leader. My fellow dancers and I learned the different types of choreography
          for dance performances. Our training sessions that led up to our performances
          were sometimes fraught with challenges. However, we continued to train
          hard and did not give up. At the end of each day, we would still put up
          a riveting performance. I feel so proud to be a part of Riverside’s Indian
          Dance! - Anandakannan Rezma</p>

        <p>My CCA experience with Malay Dance has been very enriching. Firstly, my
          CCA members are very fun to be with. I have forged many beautiful memories
          with them. Secondly, as the vice-chairperson of Malay Dance, I am given
          many opportunities to lead my fellow dancers at various events and performances.
          This has helped me to understand what leadership is. I am thankful for
          all these opportunities to pursue my passion in Malay Dance. - Naimi Irdina

        <p>It has been a great pleasure to be part of modern dance. I treasure the
          moments and friendship forged during CCA the most. As our dance motto goes,
          ‘Dance to express, not to impress’. Dancing provides me an outlet to express
          myself in different art forms. Being in modern dance has taught me resilience
          and perseverance, and helped me to sharpen my leadership skills as an individual
          too. - Pearlynn Chan Zi Yi</p>

        <p>My experience in English Drama has definitely been very enriching and
          unforgettable, as I got to forge new bonds with my fellow members and picked
          up new skills, especially leadership skills. In addition, I learned other
          useful skills such as production management which includes looking into
          characters' costumes, lines, props and giving stage directions. Overall,
          being in Drama has been an exciting experience, and I hope that our future
          Drama members will also have fun during CCA sessions. - Ng Zi Hern</p>
