<p>As a member of the AV crew, I have the experience of working backstage
to support the various events held by the school. My first event involved
supporting our school’s Speech Day. It was a challenging experience but
with the amazing support of my seniors and teachers, I managed to learn
meaningful lessons. I always look forward to working with the rest of the
AV crew as we work hand in hand to make every school event a success. -

<p>When I first joined Media Club, everything seemed new to me. I had a hard
time learning the basics of photography. I saw this as a challenge that
I had to overcome. My journey was not easy but thanks to my seniors and
teachers, I sharpened my skills and am now more confident in presenting
my work. I’m glad that I was given the opportunity to lead the club as
one of the EXCO members. - Bilah Izzah Bahirah Binte Mohammad Noor</p>

<p>Participating in robotics competitions and workshops can start off easy
but become progressively challenging. Despite this, our club members always
support one another to overcome challenges through discussions and trial
and error. We learned important values such as teamwork and perseverance.
We also sharpened our critical thinking skills through the process. Now,
we seniors are guiding our juniors for their competitions so that they
will have a great experience as well! – Nitin</p>

<p>In Environmental Science Club, I learned how to manage hydroponics sets.
This has developed values such as responsibility in my peers and me as
we have to clean and refill the water tank weekly. I also had the opportunity
to prepare for the school-wide celebration for Earth Day 2023 and contributed
to the creation of learning materials used to educate and inspire my school-mates
to reduce their carbon footprint. My time in this CCA has taught me about
how we can use Science to reduce Man’s impact on the environment. - Chee

<p>In Badminton, we learned the basic skills of badminton such as ways to
swing the racket and the correct footwork. We worked closely during intensive
training to prepare ourselves for competitions. While the road would be
fraught with many challenges, we always put in our best efforts in all
the training sessions. Even if we did not achieve our target, we know we
have tried our best and we are proud of ourselves. - Yuki Lee</p>

<p>I’ve had such an amazing experience being in basketball! Even though the

in basketball also helped me make good friends whom I can trust and enjoy
the CCA with. I appreciate the opportunity to help my juniors and for me
to grow as a basketball player together with the team. I will never forget
all the memorable and fun moments during the training sessions. - Amirah

<p>I believe that our Football team has improved in many aspects. Our ‘C’
and ‘B’ Divisions teams did well for the National School Games. Everyone
looks forward to CCA training sessions and gives their all to be better
players and teammates. I believe that if we continue to work hard and encourage
one another, we will improve even more as individual players and as a team.
Our teachers and coaches have instilled a sense of togetherness within
the team and we are definitely stronger together. I am very proud to be
the captain of Riverside Football! - Iqbal Haqim</p>

<p>I've had many memorable experiences playing netball in Riverside. Being
in netball introduced me to the skills of the game and also to a new group
of friends. My teammates and I have formed strong bonds and even play netball
together beyond the training sessions. I experienced some highs and lows
during my CCA sessions. However, with the support of my teachers and teammates,
I persevered. My teammates and I always strive to do our best to achieve
the goals we have set for the team. - Oh Li En</p>

team has improved in many aspects especially in terms of skills, resilience

CCA very enjoyable. Taking part in competitions also spurred everyone to

<p>My experience in BB thus far has been like a dive into an ocean of opportunity.
In BB, I was given many opportunities to hone my character and be an active
contributor to society. I also learned soft skills such as leadership and
teamwork, and also learned technical skills like tent setting and kayaking.
The memories I have made bonding with my peers through BB will be memories
that I will cherish for many years to come. - Staff Sergeant Casimsiman

<p>Being a part of GB has given me a wide range of learning experience. From
our annual day camp to our badgework, my squadmates and I have gained values

problem-solving and servant leadership. We know that no matter the activity
we participate in, we will always get something enriching out of it. -
