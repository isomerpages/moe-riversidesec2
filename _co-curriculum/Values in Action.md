Through Values in Action, Riversidians will better understand the community they are situated in and take concrete steps to make a positive impact to those around them. In doing so, students live out the value of service and grow to become active contributors of society.

  

Students go through the process of:

1.  Sensing - to understand the needs to the community they are serving
2.  Planning - to develop action plans that address the needs of the community
3.  Execution - to carry out their action plans
4.  Reflection - to review their plans and distil learning and purpose from their experiences

  

They exercise their influence and make a positive impact in their own homes, the school-wide community and the wider Woodlands community.
