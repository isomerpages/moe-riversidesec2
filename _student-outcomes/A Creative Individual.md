Self-expression and creativity play a critical role in a childâ€™s holistic development. Engaging with the arts helps students develop empathic intelligence, which enhances their emotional engagement, commitment and persistence. This can build their confidence as well as their sense of identity.

  

Every Riversidian is provided with opportunities to develop their appreciation for the arts and to learn how to express themselves through a broad expression of arts.
