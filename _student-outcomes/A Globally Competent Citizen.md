With globalisation, the world has become more diverse and interconnected. In this rapidly changing world, students need to be aware about global issues and possess a desire to contribute to the well-being of the international community while maintaining a sense of rootedness.

  

Every Riversidian is given opportunities to explore and examine pertinent global issues, appreciate multiple perspectives, and evaluate the global trends and their interconnections with local communities. Through the process, they will be equipped with critical thinking and tools to be agents of change.
